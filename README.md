# 3D-Printed Pressure Measurement Devices GUI
An intuitive GUI for interfacing with 2D and 3D pressure measurement devices. Built with PyQt6.
The GUI is available for both 2D and 3D pressure measurement configurations.

**Prerequisites**

Xming X Server for Windows must be installed on your computer to run the GUI.
The requirements.txt file specifies the necessary Python libraries. We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid any version conflicts.

**Setup**

Sensor_points.txt and interpolation_points.txt should be updated based on the sensor locations and a mapping point for pressure measurement.
Run Interface_2D.py and Interface_3D.py for 2D and 3D pressure mats, respectively.

Acknowledgment
Thanks to Jessica Tsai for designing and developing the GUI.
